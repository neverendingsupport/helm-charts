description: NES Universal Helm Chart

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into
# versioned archives to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer.
# They're included as a dependency of application charts to inject those
# utilities and functions into the rendering pipeline. Library charts do not
# define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# The chart version is what one `helm install`s; it matters in a helm registry
# but doesn't matter when ArgoCD installing from a git branch.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: "1.0.0"

# subcharts, aka "the main reason people haven't abandoned helm"
